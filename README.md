Doon City Bus Tracker (Prototype)

Doon City Bus Tracker is a web-based simulation dashboard designed to demonstrate a real-time public transport tracking system for the city of Dehradun, India.

This application visualizes vehicle movements, calculates live ETAs, and simulates a REST API stream, all running within the browser.

⚠️ PROTOTYPE NOTICE: > This project is a simulation prototype intended for demonstration and development purposes only. It does not connect to real GPS hardware, actual bus transit databases, or live satellite feeds. All vehicle movements, routes, and "API" data are generated algorithmically by the client-side JavaScript engine to mimic a real-world environment.

🚀 Features

Interactive Live Map: Uses Leaflet.js to display routes and moving vehicle markers on a dark-mode map of Dehradun.

Simulated GPS Ingestion: A physics engine mimics vehicle movement along specific coordinates (PolyLines) with variable speeds.

Real-Time ETA Calculation: Algorithms compute the estimated time of arrival to the next stop based on current simulated coordinates.

Operational Dashboard: A side panel displaying active fleet statistics, average speeds, and individual vehicle status.

API Inspector: A built-in overlay that reveals the raw JSON data structure, simulating what a real backend REST endpoint (/api/v1/vehicles/live) would return.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS to function seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

📍 Simulated Routes

The prototype currently simulates two primary transit corridors in Dehradun:

Blue Line (Route 101): ISBT Dehradun ↔ Pacific Mall (via Clock Tower & Rajpur Road).

Orange Line (Route 205): Prem Nagar ↔ Raipur Stadium (via IMA & Parade Ground).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Mapping: Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap, CartoDB Dark Matter tiles

Icons: FontAwesome

📦 Installation & Usage

Since this is a client-side Single Page Application (SPA), no server installation is required.

Download the index.html file.

Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

The simulation will start automatically.

🎮 Controls

API Stream: Click the "API Stream" button in the header to view the raw JSON data being generated by the simulation engine.

Reset Sim: Click "Reset Sim" to clear all vehicles and restart the tracking loop.

Focus Vehicle: Click on any vehicle card in the left sidebar to zoom the map camera to that specific bus.
